Flood-It!

A Popular smartphone/table game where the objective is to flood the game board in as few steps as possible by changing your areas colors
to envelop adjacent squares with matching colors until the board is completely flooded.

The challenge of the game was to make the alloted moves given based off a greedy algorithm calculated by the program where it is always
off of the move that would immediately turn the most adjacent boxes with no long term site in play.
